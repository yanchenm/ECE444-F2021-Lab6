### Pros and Cons of TDD

The major pros of test driven development are that it forces testing to be an integral part of the software development process. By writing tests before writing the functionality, we ensure that we go into the development process knowing exactly what is expected of our code. TDD also ensure that unit tests remain decoupled from the actual implementation of the functionality. If we write the tests before the functionality even exists, that absolutely ensures that our tests aren't assuming too much about the implementation, a problem that can often occur if tests are written after the fact.

However, one of the major cons of TDD is the additional overhead that it adds. Especially in a fast-paced project with tight deadlines like in this couse, the additional overhead of doing TDD across the entire team makes timelines infeasible.
